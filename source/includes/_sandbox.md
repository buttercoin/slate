# Sandbox

> If you test any scenarios that involve withdrawing bitcoins from your Buttercoin account, please send them back to the following address when you're done:

```

```

To help you test your more complicated workflows, we've created a sandbox environment that uses testnet bitcoins and fake funds.

Each Buttercoin SDK client allows you to include a sandbox environment parameter during initialization. Please see SDK documentation for details.

To use the sandbox, you will need to create a sandbox account.  If you'd like one, [let us know](mailto:api@buttercoin.com?subject=Add%20A%20Sandbox%20Account).  We'll send you an invitation email with instructions.
